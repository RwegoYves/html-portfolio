<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Abatangana Rwego Yves is Civil engineer, a web developer and an artist. I’m based in Rwanda, I am always curious enough 
  to learn more things, where while Attending my academic Engineering program I was already attending parallerally coding classes
  especially web development, though at that point I already had experience of years in art of photography, which I started
  as a hobby, a way of having fun with my friends and sooner I participated and won the second place in an international and 
  I was recognized as a photographer, I realized that I needed to understand photography as an art form. I started 
  educating myself, reading and learning more about photography and I finally attended school of cinematography. 
  Later I participated Art-Rwanda Ubuhanzi competition and won with my group category, I acquired more experience 
  due to the competition working on Petit pays film project and much more. Grounded in fine art, I’m really passionate 
  about art in general and especially photography.
